DEVLOG (TEAM FILE_INSERT)

Instructions:
Devlog allows any group member at any time to see the current state of the project.
PM will make sure devlog is being maintained, but will not make all entries.
The devlog should be a plain text file, stored in the specified location.
When any team member stops working and pushes changes to github,
they should update the devlog explaining what changes have been made.
Include errors/bugs discovered (or created).
Separate devlog entries with a newline.
Most recent entry at the bottom.
Each entry should begin with the following format:
firstL -- TIMESTAMP\n ( e.g.: topherM -- 1999-12-31 23:59 )
fi indicates we all worked together

liamK (fi) -- 2021-1-21 09:59
- successfully served flaskapp
- successfully served project0
- worked out path bugs in .wsgi and .conf files
- created __init__.py file for p0
- successfully ran app

FI -- 2021-01-27 21:00
- Issue encountered: app would crash randomly when hosted on IP, but not when served locally.
- First step: remove try/except blocks from affected functions to determine source of error
- Once completed, we checked /var/log/apache2/error.log, and repeatedly saw this error as the cause
of our site crashing: sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file, referer: http://165.22.181.161/create_account

- Attempts made to fix:
1. Restarted apache2
2. Updated apache2, restarted
3. Changed file permissions for blog.db and dir containing blog.db
4. Changed ownership of directory / blog.db to www:data
5. Added directory of current file to sys.path list, tried both with/without trailing backslash
6. Attempted to reference entire path of blog.db ("var/www/SoftDevProj0/app/blog.db")
